# A data science project on Covid19.

The project consists of two dynamic dashboards.

The first dashboard displays everyday Coronavirus statistics for every country.
The second dashboard consists of different variants of a SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered)  model, commonly used to study the spread of covid-19 .

	- SEIRD model (Exposed and Dead component with SIR)
        - Effect of lockdown, quarantines etc. on the spread of disease.
        - A SIR forecasting model to study the time evolution of different 	populations and track various important parameters of disease 	        transmission in different countries.
